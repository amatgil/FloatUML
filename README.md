# FloatUML
## Usage
Press F10 to enable text input. The format is as follows (square brackets mean optionality):
- Class: `class Name { atr1: typ1 atr2: typ2 etc. }`
- Relation: `rel [AssocNom] { class1 multlower2 multhigher2 class2 multlower2 multhigher2 class3 multlower3 multhigher3 ... }`


As soon as the input is correct, the schema on the left will be redrawn to match. Classes may be dragged around and positioned as desired. To save, press `C-s`.
